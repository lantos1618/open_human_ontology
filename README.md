# OpenHuman: An Open-Source Human Body Documentation Project

## Overview
OpenHuman is a comprehensive, open-source documentation project that aims to describe the human body in a structured, code-like format. This project bridges the gap between biological understanding and software documentation patterns, making human anatomy and physiology more accessible and interconnected.

## Using with Obsidian
This documentation is optimized for viewing in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. To get the best experience:

1. Download and install Obsidian
2. Open this repository as a vault
3. Enable the following plugins:
   - Graph View (for relationship visualization)
   - Mermaid (for diagrams)
   - Backlinks (for reference tracking)
   - Page Preview (for quick reference)

### Key Features in Obsidian
- **Wiki-style Links**: Use [[file_name]] to create connections
- **Interactive Graphs**: Visualize relationships between concepts
- **Dynamic References**: Track what references each component
- **Visual Diagrams**: View Mermaid diagrams inline
- **Tag System**: Use #tags for additional categorization

### Relationship Types
We use standardized relationship types to create a semantic network:
- `is_part_of`: Component relationships
- `contains`: Structural relationships
- `interacts_with`: Functional interactions
- `regulated_by`: Control mechanisms
- `produces`: Output relationships
- See `RELATIONSHIPS.md` for complete list

## Project Goals
- Create a structured representation of human anatomy and physiology
- Document biological processes in a clear, interconnected format
- Provide a collaborative platform for medical knowledge sharing
- Enable easy navigation through body systems and processes
- Bridge the gap between biological understanding and technical documentation

## Documentation Format
Each component is documented using a structured format:

```markdown
# Component Name
## Description
## Relationships
## Structure
## Function
## Regulation
## Clinical Significance
## References
```

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from:
- Medical professionals
- Biologists
- Technical writers
- Software developers
- Anyone interested in human biology

## Future Scope
- Interactive visualizations
- API for accessing human body data
- Integration with medical education tools
- Machine-readable formats for research
- Cross-referencing with medical literature

## Getting Started
