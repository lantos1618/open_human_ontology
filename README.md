# OpenHuman: An Open-Source Human Body Ontology Documentation Project

## Overview
OpenHuman is a comprehensive, open-source documentation project that aims to describe the human body in a structured, code-like format. This project bridges the gap between biological understanding and software documentation patterns, making human anatomy and physiology more accessible and interconnected.

## Project Goals
- Create a structured representation of human anatomy and physiology
- Document biological processes in a clear, interconnected format
- Provide a collaborative platform for medical knowledge sharing
- Enable easy navigation through body systems and processes
- Bridge the gap between biological understanding and technical documentation

## Documentation Format
Each component will be documented using a structured format:

```markdown
# Component Name
## Description
## Structure
## Function
## Interactions
## Processes
## References
```

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from:
- Medical professionals
- Biologists
- Technical writers
- Software developers
