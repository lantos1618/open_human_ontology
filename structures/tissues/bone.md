# Bone Tissue

## Description
Bone tissue is a specialized form of connective tissue characterized by a mineralized extracellular matrix that provides both strength and flexibility. It is continuously remodeled throughout life in response to mechanical and metabolic demands.

## Relationships

- `regulated_by`: [[bone_metabolism]] - Homeostatic control
- `produces`: [[bone_marrow]] - Hematopoietic tissue
- `connects_to`: [[cartilage]] - At joints
- `modulates`: [[calcium_homeostasis]] - Mineral storage
