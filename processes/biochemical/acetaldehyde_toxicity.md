# Acetaldehyde Toxicity

## Description
Acetaldehyde toxicity occurs when this reactive metabolite of ethanol accumulates in tissues, leading to various adverse effects including DNA damage, protein modifications, and cellular dysfunction. It is a key factor in alcohol-related pathologies.

## Relationships
- `caused_by`: [[ethanol_metabolism]] - Primary source
- `depends_on`: [[ALDH2_deficiency]] - Major risk factor
- `affects`: [[cellular_damage]] - Direct effect
- `triggers`: [[alcohol_flush_reaction]] - Immediate response
- `contributes_to`: [[carcinogenesis]] - Long-term risk
- `modulates`: [[inflammatory_response]] - Cellular effect
- `interacts_with`: [[DNA_repair_mechanisms]] - Molecular impact
