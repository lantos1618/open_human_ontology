# Ethanol Metabolism

## Description
Ethanol metabolism is the biological process by which alcohol (ethanol) is broken down in the body, primarily in the liver, through a series of enzymatic reactions that convert it to acetaldehyde and then to acetic acid.

## Relationships
- `depends_on`: [[liver_function]] - Primary site of metabolism
- `involves`: [[ADH1B]], [[ALDH2]] - Key enzymes
- `produces`: [[acetaldehyde]] - Intermediate metabolite
- `affects`: [[NAD_NADH_ratio]] - Redox balance
- `modulates`: [[gluconeogenesis]] - Metabolic impact
- `interacts_with`: [[CYP2E1_pathway]] - Alternative pathway
- `regulates`: [[alcohol_intoxication]] - Physiological effects

## Key Enzymes

### 1. Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH)

    C[ADH1B] --> D[Variable Activity]
    E[ADH1C] --> F[Polymorphic]
    end
```

### 2. Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH)
- [[ALDH2]] - Primary enzyme
- [[ALDH1A1]] - Cytosolic form
- Activity variations
- Genetic polymorphisms

## Reaction Steps

### 1. Ethanol to Acetaldehyde
```mermaid

    participant ADH as ADH
    participant NAD as NAD+
    participant A as Acetaldehyde
    
    E->>ADH: Binding
    NAD->>ADH: Cofactor binding
    ADH->>A: Oxidation
    Note over A: + NADH + H+
```

### 2. Acetaldehyde to Acetate
```mermaid

    participant A as Acetaldehyde
    participant ALDH as ALDH2
    participant NAD as NAD+
    participant AC as Acetate
    
    A->>ALDH: Binding
    NAD->>ALDH: Cofactor binding
    ALDH->>AC: Oxidation
    Note over AC: + NADH + H+
```

## Regulation

### 1. Metabolic Control
- Substrate availability
- NAD+/NADH ratio
- Enzyme expression
- Hormonal factors

### 2. Rate-Limiting Steps

    E[Substrate Level] --> F[Initial Rate]
```

## Clinical Implications

- Gluconeogenesis inhibition
- Fatty acid metabolism
- Lactate accumulation

### 2. Pathological Conditions
- [[alcoholic_liver_disease]]
- [[alcohol_flush_reaction]]
- [[metabolic_acidosis]]
- [[hypoglycemia]]

## Population Variations

### 1. Genetic Polymorphisms
```mermaid

    A[ADH1B*2] --> B[Fast Metabolism]
    C[ALDH2*2] --> D[Reduced Clearance]
    E[Population Distribution] --> F[Ethnic Differences]
```

### 2. Environmental Factors
