# mRNA Vaccines

## Overview
mRNA vaccines represent a breakthrough in vaccine technology, delivering messenger RNA to cells to produce viral proteins that trigger an immune response. This approach combines the safety of non-live vaccines with the strong immune response typically associated with live vaccines.

## Molecular Structure

   - Untranslated regions (UTRs)

2. **Modifications**
   - N1-methylpseudouridine substitution
   - Optimized codon usage
   - Enhanced stability elements
   - Secondary structure optimization

3. **Delivery System**
