# Vaccine Types and Mechanisms

## Overview
Vaccines are biological preparations that provide active acquired immunity against specific pathogens. Different types of vaccines use various mechanisms to stimulate the immune system and provide protection against diseases.

## Types of Vaccines

### 1. Live Attenuated Vaccines
- **Mechanism**: Contains weakened form of live pathogen
- **Examples**: MMR, Chickenpox, Yellow Fever
- **Advantages**:
  - Strong immune response
  - Long-lasting immunity
  - Often requires fewer doses
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Not suitable for immunocompromised individuals
  - Requires careful storage and handling
  - Small risk of reversion to virulence

### 2. Inactivated Vaccines
- **Mechanism**: Contains killed pathogen
- **Examples**: Polio (IPV), Hepatitis A, Flu shot
- **Advantages**:
  - Safer than live vaccines
  - More stable
  - Can't cause disease
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Weaker immune response
  - Usually requires multiple doses
  - Often needs adjuvants

### 3. Subunit Vaccines
- **Mechanism**: Contains specific parts of pathogen
- **Examples**: Hepatitis B, HPV, Pertussis
- **Advantages**:
  - Very safe
  - Precise immune targeting
  - Consistent production
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires adjuvants
  - Multiple doses needed
  - May have limited protection

### 4. Toxoid Vaccines
- **Mechanism**: Contains inactivated toxins
- **Examples**: Tetanus, Diphtheria
- **Advantages**:
  - Targets specific toxins
  - Well-established safety
  - Stable
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Only works for toxin-producing pathogens
  - Requires boosters
  - Limited application

### 5. Viral Vector Vaccines
- **Mechanism**: Uses modified virus to deliver pathogen genes
- **Examples**: Johnson & Johnson COVID-19, Ebola
- **Advantages**:
  - Strong immune response
  - Cell and antibody immunity
  - Efficient delivery
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Pre-existing immunity to vector
  - Complex manufacturing
  - Storage requirements

### 6. mRNA Vaccines
- **Mechanism**: Delivers genetic instructions for antigen production
- **Examples**: Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna COVID-19
- **Advantages**:
  - Rapid development
  - Precise immune targeting
  - No live components
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Storage requirements
  - New technology
  - Cost

### 7. DNA Vaccines
- **Mechanism**: Delivers DNA encoding pathogen proteins
- **Examples**: Various veterinary vaccines
- **Advantages**:
  - Stable
  - Easy to manufacture
  - Flexible design
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Delivery challenges
  - Lower immunogenicity
  - Multiple doses needed

## Delivery Mechanisms

### 1. Intramuscular (IM)
- Most common route for many vaccines
- Good absorption and distribution
- Used for: mRNA, inactivated vaccines

### 2. Subcutaneous (SC)
- Injection into fatty tissue
- Slower absorption than IM
- Used for: Live attenuated vaccines

### 3. Intradermal
- Injection into skin layers
- Rich in immune cells
- Used for: Some flu vaccines, BCG

### 4. Oral
- Through digestive system
- Easy administration
- Used for: Polio (OPV), Rotavirus

### 5. Nasal
- Through nasal passages
- Targets mucosal immunity
- Used for: Flu (LAIV)

## Adjuvants and Delivery Systems

### Common Adjuvants
1. Aluminum salts (Alum)
2. Oil-in-water emulsions
3. Toll-like receptor agonists
4. Virosomes
5. AS01/AS04 combinations

### Modern Delivery Systems
1. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)
2. Polymeric particles
3. Virus-like particles (VLPs)
4. Microencapsulation
5. Transdermal patches

## Immune Response Mechanisms

### Primary Response
1. Antigen recognition
2. Dendritic cell activation
3. T cell activation
4. B cell activation
5. Antibody production

### Memory Formation
